Violation Elimination Report
============================

As soon as the monitoring in ``addressed`` status, its tender owner can provide a report about violation eliminations:

.. include:: http/elimination-report-post.http
   :code:

We have already seen how to get ``tender_token`` in :ref:`dialogue` section

Now let's update our report:

.. include:: http/elimination-report-edit.http
   :code:

That's it.
