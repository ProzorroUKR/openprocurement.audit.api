Acceleration mode for sandbox
=============================

Acceleration mode was developed to enable procedures' testing in the sandbox and to reduce time frames of these procedures. 

**This mode will work only in the sandbox**.

To enable acceleration mode you will need to:

    * add additional parameter `mode` with a value ``test``;
    * set ``accelerator=1440`` as text value for `monitoringDetails`. This parameter will accelerate auction periods. The number 1440 shows that restrictions and time frames will be reduced in 1440 times.
